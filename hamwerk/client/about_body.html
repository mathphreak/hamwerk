Hamwerk was made with love and frustration by [Matt Horn](http://mathphreak.github.io/).

If something isn't working, or you have an idea for a cool new feature, submit it
[here](https://github.com/mathphreak/hamwerk/issues).

It uses the excellent [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) framework, along with
[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/),
and a host of other libraries:

* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [Amplify](http://amplifyjs.com/)

I made it with the following tools:

* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) because Meteor worked really badly on Windows when I first started
* [Atom](http://atom.io/) because it's the best text editor I've used
* [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) because it's the best Git GUI for GitHub repositories

If you're curious, the entire source code for Hamwerk is available on
[<i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i> GitHub](https://github.com/mathphreak/hamwerk).
